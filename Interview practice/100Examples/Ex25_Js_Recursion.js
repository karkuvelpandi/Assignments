/*Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function 
that calls itself is called a recursive function.

A recursive function must have a condition to stop calling itself. Otherwise, the function is called indefinitely.

Once the condition is met, the function stops calling itself. This is called a base condition.

To prevent infinite recursion, you can use if...else statement (or similar approach) where one branch makes the recursive call, and the other doesn't.
